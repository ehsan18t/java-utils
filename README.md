  <strong>Utilities classes for java to make life easier</strong>
</div>

&nbsp;
## 💠 Introduction
Well, recently I were doing some java projects. Oh, boy... there were some things that should've been existed in java by default, but it's not. So I made some classes to make my life easier. ;)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## 📜 Features
- `SceneManager` class to manage JavaFX scenes easily.
- `FileIO` class to read/write/check serialized objects/files.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## 💡 How to use?
- Download/clone the repo.
- Add package `dev.pages.ahsan.utils` to your project.
- Done... Now use it as you like...

**Note:** Example codes and detail explanations will be added later. But there are documentations inside each class. I hope those explanations will be more than enough to start. Best of luck :)
